      <h1>Cool problems</h1>
      <p class="well">
        Here are some cool riddles and computer programming problems (also some math ones).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hats: 100 hats some black some white, put them on dwarves and line them up in a row. How can the most number of dwarves survive? (Perfect logicians). The only thing that the dwarves can say is the hats color, and they go from tallest to shortest. Tallest person can see all the hats except his own, next tallest can see all the hats in front of him etc<br> 
        Hats2: 100 hats some black some white some pink<br>
        Hats3: 1000000 hats 1000000000 different colors / types of hats<br>
        set [0, 1, 2, ... n-1]. can the sum of 2 permutations of this set in mod n be a permutation of the original set? <br>
        ex n=3, [0, 1, 2] + [0, 1, 2] = [0, 2, 1] mod 3 which works<br>
        12 coins. 1 is fake (heavy or light). find it in 3 weighings<br>
        10 pirates. Strict pecking order. Each proposes a plan to split the gold they just found. Pirates want to maximize their own gold, but will spare a pirate if doing so does not change the ammount of gold he gets. How much gold can the first pirate get?
